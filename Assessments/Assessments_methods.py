1.	Frequent code reviews: This allows for an assessment of the engineer's coding abilities and adherence to best practices1.
2.	Asking the engineer to review others' code: This can show the engineer's ability to understand and critique code written by others, providing insight into their technical knowledge and collaborative skills1.
3.	Inspecting their documentation: The quality of an engineer's documentation can be a strong indicator of their attention to detail and ability to communicate complex ideas clearly1.
4.	Observing how they work in a team: Teamwork is a crucial part of software development, and an engineer's ability to work well in a team can be as important as their individual technical skills1.
5.	Conducting regular one-on-one meetings: These meetings can provide insight into the engineer's thoughts about the project, its positive and negative aspects, and their overall engagement with their work1.
6.	Measuring their contributions to improving technology processes, such as CI/CD or training for the team1.
