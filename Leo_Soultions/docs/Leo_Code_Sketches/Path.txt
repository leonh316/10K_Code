Math & Geometry:

Dive into more advanced mathematical and geometric concepts as they apply to computer science.
Solve problems using these concepts.
1-D DP (Dynamic Programming):

Learn the concept of dynamic programming.
Start with 1-D dynamic programming problems.
2-D DP (Dynamic Programming):

Once comfortable with 1-D DP, extend your understanding to 2-D DP problems.
Bit Manipulation:

Understand how bit manipulation works and how it can be used to optimize solutions.
Sliding Window:

Learn the sliding window technique to solve array/string problems.
