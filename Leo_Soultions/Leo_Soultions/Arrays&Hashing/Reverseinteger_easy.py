"""2. Reverse Integer - Easy

Given a positive single-digit integer x, return x with its digit reversed. 
As x is a single-digit integer, the output will be the same as the input. 
If the input is not a single-digit integer, then return 0.

The valid input range is from 0 to 9. 
No constraints regarding the storage of integers apply in this scenario. 
This problem is designed to help you understand the concept of integer reversal. """
